        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Dodge Challenger is the name of three different generations of automobiles produced by the American automobile manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge dates back to 1959 for marketing a "value version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger.The Sapporo and Challenger were redesigned in 1981 with revised bodywork with increased footroom, headroom, trunk capacity, and soundproofing.Both cars were marketed until 1983, when they were replaced by the Conquest using the same rear-wheel-drive platform through 1989, and in 1984 by the front-wheel-drive Laser and Daytona.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Dodge's early to mid-1970s factory-supported "Kit Car" program for short-track late-model stock car racing offered a choice of Challenger, and a few (less than 12) were made. Still, in 1974, Dodge ended the Challenger line, and they went to the Dodge Dart Sports and Dodge Aspen bodies over a steel-tube chassis.Blackforest Motorsports has currently entered a Challenger in the Continental Challenge.The Challenger R/T has been used as the Chrysler model for starting in 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series competition.</p>
